Pandora NanoLemmings 0.1.0
==========================

Did you like the classic game Lemmings?

Did you enjoy saving those little guys by digging
and building bridges to survive a rough terrain?

Did you hate the micro-management and clicking on
a lemming that is walking in the wrong direction?

Would you like to play with THOUSANDS of lemmings
instead of just a few dozen?

Then maybe NanoLemmings is a game for you!


In NanoLemmings, there are thousands of tiny lemmings
to be saved. Like in the original Lemmings, they can
dig through the earth, build bridges, climb walls,
get umbrellas to land softly and survive big falls,
and of course explode.  Unlike the original, you don't
assign these tasks or skills to individual lemmings.
There simply are too many of them!

Instead, you can draw bridges to be built and tunnels
to be dug on the screen. When a nanolemming can contribute
to the bridge or tunnel, it will.

In the original Lemmings, bridge builders magically get
a backpack filled with bricks. In NanoLemmings, bridges
are built with the nanolemmings themselves: they get
themselves 'petrified', supporting one another in order
to collectively 'build' a bridge. This petrification
can be undone by 'digging' into a bridge. Be careful
though, bridges can collapse!




Credits:

   This game was conceived and coded by _wb_ (Jon Sneyers).
   As usual, all coding was done on the Pandora itself.

   The music is by Dr.Awesome (Bjorn Lynne), and was composed in
   the eighties and early nineties on the Amiga.
   It is in the ProTracker MOD format, which has only 4 channels.
   Only a master like Dr.Awesome can make it sound that good within
   those limitations.
   You can find his current music on www.shockwave-sound.com.

   The sound effects were created by EvilDragon (Michael Mrozek).

   The pixel art was done by mcobit.

   Matthias_H wrote a level image generator that was used to make
   most of the levels look better. Thanks!
